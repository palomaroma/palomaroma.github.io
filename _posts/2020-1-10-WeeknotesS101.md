Things that happened this week at work
updated the team org chart to make clear each others’ responsibilities and line managers in the light of forthcoming arrivals
explored and drafted advice around email for social care
supported my team with their work, recruited a new team member and supported a new starter in my old team to get her work under way
talked the team through agile ways of working and made a proposal for how we could work in sprints - crits were popular!
met with KPMG social care and data leads to hear more about their on the ground experience of digital transformation
met with a friend with history in social care tech for lots of useful context
facilitated a get to know each other session for two teams in my old area
contributed to framing a request for legal advice on standards compliance

<p>Things that happened personally
had a coaching session about my digital leadership with areas to work on
met a potential policy mentor and agreed how we would work together
supported my son in his exam and my daughter to prepare for her talent show
set up the remaining coaching sessions I need to do to complete the course
signed up to do a blog post on the intranet about my year of coaching

<p>Reflections
don’t lose sight of the big picture and what is right for the future, particularly the end goal we set out in the tech vision
use your network for context and data to inform your work
you can learn a lot from being around people whose leadership approach you admire

<p>Reminders
I will meet one person a week from my tweet response or other contact 
I will make sure the advice I give has the obvious numbers 
I will keep a ‘key facts’ document for numbers
I will keep a log of bemusing policy scenarios for discussion with my mentor
I will identify a work hero to observe
